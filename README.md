## ‚úç Customizing Tailwind Typography

[Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) is an official tailwind plugin that provides a set of `prose` classes to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you don't control (like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS).

To customize the defaults provided by the plugin, add the overrides under the `typography` key in the theme section of the `tailwind.config.js` file. Refer to its [default styles](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/blob/master/src/styles.js) for more in-depth examples.

For more information, please check out Tailwind Typography's [customization section](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography#customization).
